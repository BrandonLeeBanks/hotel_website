            <p>The Relax Inn was founded in 1857, the reason behind it was to give the working class an affordable and memorable hotel to relax and unwind, we have updated a few things since then. </p>
            <p>But the outcome is always the same, you being relaxed and ready for more work.</p>

                <p>Where do I start, I was so pleased with the meeting location and space. The hospitality in this hotel has nothing short of "Service Excellence". The rooms are spacious, clean and super comfortable. The banquet staff was extremely attentive to every detail and very professional. Thanks again for all your help I am sure our group will be back again.</p>

                    <p>The service at The Relax Inn Hotel was exceptional. There was absolutely no issue that was not addressed timely and with satisfactory results. We were particularly impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs (periodically coming by the Board Room to check in with us). We will continue to do business with this hotel for years to come.</p>
